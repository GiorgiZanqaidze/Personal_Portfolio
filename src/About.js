I love this profession but i decided to try another one, so i started learning of programing languages. I think i will connect thise two profession to each other.<br></br> <br></br>Firstly, i started with javascript and my first project was breakout. After that i learned HTML and CSS. I got fluent in responsive web design. After that i decided to implement javascript into HTML and CSS. I started to make more complex websites and apps.<br></br> <br></br>I have been learning programming for 8 months from free courses. I'm selftaught and don't have experience working for companies. At the moment i'm learning react which is library of javascript. I already have couple of projects using react.</p>
